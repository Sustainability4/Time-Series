# What is Time-Series ? Why it is difficult from the normal Regression problems ? Why there has been a lot of books written on time series ? 
Lets consider a situation of a ice-cream cone seller. He wants to predict the sales in future so that he can maintain his inventory. He generates two data, one being the sales of cones vs the temperature that day and other being the sales of cones historically till this moment. If, he wants to predict the cone sales tomorrow and just notices the temperature forecast for tomorrow, he can go back and look for the sales at that particular temperature in the past and can make a prediction for tomorrow. This is a type of interpolation exercise on the data already available. In case of a time series data we are predicting the sale in future based on data in the past. This is an extrapolation exercise which is much more uncertain and difficult to analyze. Lets say Ice cream seller wants to know the sales tomorrow. He may be able to do predict that based upon the sales data in the past and will be confident about his predictions. But, the sales data predictions for a week from now may not be as good as the predictions are for tomorrow.
